# Step 1: Introduction to Generative AI on AWS

## Goal
Get comfortable with core concepts and tools for free so you can start building in Step 2.

## 1) Learn the basics (fast)
Work through these two AWS skill builder modules and refer to prompting guidelines as you build.
* **[Introduction to Generative AI – Art of the Possible](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/courses/17176/introduction-to-generative-ai-art-of-the-possible) (AWS Skill Builder, 1 hr, free):** Short, non‑mathy overview of how modern generative AI works and where it’s useful.  
* **[Foundations of Prompt Engineering](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/courses/17763/foundations-of-prompt-engineering) (AWS Skill Builder, 4hr, free):** Practical prompting patterns you’ll reuse with Bedrock models.  
* **[Prompt engineering guidelines](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/prompt-engineering-guidelines.html) (Bedrock docs):** Official guidance you can reference while you build.  

## 2) Set up your environment: Choose a safe place to practice without paying
* **[AWS Educate:](https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/)** Beginner‑friendly console and labs. Great for learning the AWS UI and fundamentals.  
* **[SageMaker Studio Lab](https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws/faq) (free):** A hosted JupyterLab that doesn’t require an AWS account. Perfect for notebooks and experiments.

<strong>Tip:</strong> If you *do* create a standard AWS account, stay within the <em>Free Tier</em>, delete resources when done, and set billing alarms.

## 3) Choose an AI assistant: set up helpful tooling
* **Amazon Q Developer (Free Tier):** An AI coding assistant for VS Code/JetBrains and in the AWS Console. Get started [here](https://aws.amazon.com/q/developer/) and refer to [pricing/limits](https://aws.amazon.com/q/developer/pricing/) to ensure you don't pay.
* **GitHub Copilot:** Students have free access through ```Settings > Billing and licensing > Education Benefits```

## 4) Quick hands‑on wins
Follow a tutorial from the [AWS Skill Builder](https://skillbuilder.aws/category/domain/artificial-intelligence) or YouTube. AWS SimuLearn is Amazon's AI-powered learning tool. Some recommended resources:
* [YouTube: Amazon Bedrock Tutorial - Build an AI Chatbot (22 min)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=dn1x8XU3jXY&t=424s)
* [YouTube: Lets Get Agentic - Create An Amazon Bedrock Agent to Query Amazon Athena on AWS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkMT8tyZ1-Y): Learn how to build a powerful data querying system using AWS Bedrock Agent, Amazon Athena, and API Gateway.
* [AWS SimuLearn: Build and Understand Code with Amazon Q (1hr, free)](https://skillbuilder.aws/learn/Y2FQ5WF2R2/aws-simulearn-build-and-understand-code-with-amazon-q/1C5TAE62YQ)
* [AWS SimuLearn: Create an AI Smart Assistant (1hr, free)](https://skillbuilder.aws/learn/PT6HBMUFM8/aws-simulearn-create-an-ai-smart-assistant/9VN4PQCUR8)

These short pieces will give you confidence before you tackle the full developer learning plan in Step 2.
