## About
This guide will help computer science undergraduates gain familiarity with AWS services, particularly in GenAI.
AWS offers [various certifications](https://d1.awsstatic.com/onedam/marketing-channels/website/aws/en_US/certification/approved/pdfs/AWS_certification_paths.pdf), which are often quite time consuming (and can have costs to take the tests).

Follow the pages in the sidebar to dive deeper into each step, find project ideas and explore appendices with additional courses, tools and communities.
