## Why build with AWS generative AI?

Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides a family of managed foundation models and developer tools under **Amazon Bedrock** and **Amazon Q Developer**. These services let developers call state‑of‑the‑art models via API, add retrieval‑augmented generation and agents, and integrate with serverless compute without managing infrastructure. AWS training highlights that generative AI has enormous potential business value but also introduces risks and costs that teams need to understand. Courses such as *Developing Generative AI Applications on AWS* emphasise that developers should be able to describe generative AI and its alignment with machine learning, explain its potential risks and benefits, and identify business value from use‑cases. Proper guardrails and documentation help maintain security and trust.

## Three‑step roadmap

| Step | Outcome |
|------|---------|
| **Step 1 – Beginner foundation** | Complete short courses on generative‑AI fundamentals, project planning and Amazon Bedrock basics. You'll learn key terminology, the steps for planning a generative‑AI project and how Bedrock works, including prompt engineering techniques. |
| **Step 2 – Developer path & certificate** | Finish the **AWS Generative AI for Developers Professional Certificate** (three courses, ~22 h total) to build agents, knowledge bases and customize foundation models. The program moves from fundamentals to advanced implementation and hands‑on projects. |
| **Step 3 – Responsible AI & documentation** | Learn to identify risks, mitigate bias and set up **Bedrock Guardrails** for multimodal filtering, denied topics, sensitive information, word filters, contextual grounding and automated reasoning. Create model cards and READMEs that outline purpose, data, failure modes and safety filters. |
