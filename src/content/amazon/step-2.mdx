# Step 2: Generative AI for Developers (AWS Skill Builder) — Earn a Digital Badge

## Goal
Complete AWS’s **[Generative AI Learning Plan for Developers (includes labs)](https://skillbuilder.aws/learning-plan/5C9XQBTXBB/generative-ai-learning-plan-for-developers-includes-labs/EGATKJP13J)** and use it to build or upgrade your project.
This path is ~21 hours and includes some subscription-required components. Do not let this frighten you! Feel free to just focus on some highlights:
* [Amazon Q Developer Getting Started (1hr)](https://skillbuilder.aws/learn/BQMRXE8AB4/amazon-q-developer-getting-started/JY4XXGZDJA?parentId=EGATKJP13J): Amazon Q Developer is a GetnAI powered assistant that helps you understand AWS operations.

What you’ll cover (high level):
* **Amazon Bedrock fundamentals:** Choose FMs and call them through one API. Understand Titan vs. third‑party models.
* **RAG with Knowledge Bases:** Ingest documents, embed, and ground responses in your data.
* **Agents for Bedrock:** Orchestrate tool use and multi‑step tasks with function calls and external APIs.
* **Guardrails:** Configure safety filters, denied topics, PII redaction, and apply them consistently.
* **Evaluation:** Spot check results; learn how to improve outputs with better prompts and retrieval.
* **Developer tooling:** Use **Amazon Q Developer** to accelerate coding in your IDE and the AWS Console.

### Build while you learn
Pick one of these to implement (or iterate on your Step‑1 draft):
* **Campus FAQ chatbot:** Upload a few campus PDFs and webpages to a Knowledge Base. Expose a chat UI.
* **Course‑notes summarizer:** Simple UI that summarizes long notes; add citations to source snippets.
* **Data assistant for a class project:** Give structured answers (JSON) that your app can use downstream.

Helpful starters:
* Workshops hub: https://workshops.aws/card/bedrock  
* “Contextual chatbot with Knowledge Bases” (blog): https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/build-a-contextual-chatbot-application-using-knowledge-bases-for-amazon-bedrock/
* Official Bedrock docs: https://aws.amazon.com/documentation-overview/bedrock/

<em>Badge or pick‑and‑choose?</em> The badge is useful, but a polished, documented app is even better. It’s fine to cherry‑pick modules that align with your project.
