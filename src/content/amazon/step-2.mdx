# Step 2: Generative AI for Developers (AWS Skill Builder) — Earn a Digital Badge

## Goal
Complete AWS’s **[Generative AI Learning Plan for Developers (includes labs)](https://skillbuilder.aws/learning-plan/5C9XQBTXBB/generative-ai-learning-plan-for-developers-includes-labs/EGATKJP13J)** and use it to build or upgrade your project.
This path is ~21 hours and includes some subscription-required components. Do not let this frighten you! Feel free to just focus on some highlights:
* [Planning a Generative AI Project (1hr, free)](https://skillbuilder.aws/learn/HU1FQRGDDZ/planning-a-generative-ai-project/SYR3SCPSHC?parentId=EGATKJP13J)
* [Foundations of Prompt Engineering (4hr, free)](https://skillbuilder.aws/learn/VF6H4SZ1BU/foundations-of-prompt-engineering/7U8XFUVXDT?parentId=EGATKJP13J): learn about different prompting techniques (zero/few-shot learning) and best practices with FMs (fundamental models)
* [Amazon Bedrock Getting Started (1hr, free)](https://skillbuilder.aws/learn/63KTRM86DQ/amazon-bedrock-getting-started/SC2Y3HMAUE?parentId=EGATKJP13J)
* [Exploring Amazon Nova models using Amazon Bedrock (2hr, free)](https://skillbuilder.aws/learn/VY9AD42GMS/exploring-amazon-nova-models-using-amazon-bedrock/XBBTWMHCSW?parentId=EGATKJP13J): Excellent for beginners, get introduced to Amazon's family of generative AI models, each of which have different capabilities.
* [Amazon Q Developer Getting Started (1hr, free)](https://skillbuilder.aws/learn/BQMRXE8AB4/amazon-q-developer-getting-started/JY4XXGZDJA?parentId=EGATKJP13J): Amazon Q Developer is a GetnAI powered assistant that helps you understand AWS operations.

### Build while you learn
Pick one of these to implement (or iterate on your Step‑1 draft):
* **Campus FAQ chatbot:** Upload a few campus PDFs and webpages to a Knowledge Base. Expose a chat UI.
<ResumeTip title="How to add a project to your resumé" variant="success">
Built a campus FAQ chatbot and data assistant using retrieval‑augmented generation—integrating Bedrock models with sources like Athena—and documented the design, logging and evaluation plan.
</ResumeTip>
* **Course‑notes summarizer:** Simple UI that summarizes long notes; add citations to source snippets.
* **Data assistant for a class project:** Give structured answers (JSON) that your app can use downstream.

Helpful starters:
* [Workshops hub](https://workshops.aws/card/bedrock)
* [“Contextual chatbot with Knowledge Bases” (blog)](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/build-a-contextual-chatbot-application-using-knowledge-bases-for-amazon-bedrock/)
* [Official Bedrock docs](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation-overview/bedrock/)

<em>Badge or pick‑and‑choose?</em> The badge is useful, but a polished, documented app is even better. It’s fine to cherry‑pick modules that align with your project.
