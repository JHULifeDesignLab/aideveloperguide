### Goal

Advance from fundamentals to hands‑on development by completing the **AWS Generative AI for Developers Professional Certificate**.  This program (about 22 h total) provides structured, project‑based learning.  Throughout the certificate you’ll gain experience with language models and foundation models, learn to use Amazon Bedrock features such as knowledge bases, agents and guardrails, and move from basic concepts to advanced implementation strategies.  The applied projects involve prompt engineering, multi‑turn conversation handling, tool integration and content‑safety enforcement.

### Core courses

1. **Getting Started with AWS Generative AI for Developers** (≈ 9 h, beginner level) – This course introduces Amazon Bedrock and the process of selecting appropriate foundation models.  It also covers responsible‑AI implementation{index=19}.  By the end you should be comfortable deploying Bedrock models and understanding their strengths and trade‑offs.
2. **Generative AI Applications with Amazon Bedrock** (≈ 8 h, beginner level) – Focus on building real applications.  You’ll learn how to develop knowledge bases, orchestrate agents and implement retrieval‑augmented generation (RAG) workflows{index=20}.  Skills include cloud‑based integration, prompt engineering, generative‑AI agents and data storage.
3. **Amazon Bedrock Customization, Optimization & Automation** (≈ 5 h, intermediate level) – Dive into model fine‑tuning, performance optimisation and automated evaluation{index=21}.  This course introduces AWS SageMaker pipelines and data processing for generative AI, teaching you to customise models and improve latency and cost.

### What you’ll gain

* **End‑to‑end knowledge** – The certificate walks you from selecting and accessing foundation models to creating AI‑driven agents, building knowledge bases, implementing RAG and optimising models.  You’ll explore features like Bedrock Knowledge Bases, Agents and Guardrails.
* **Hands‑on projects** – Each course includes projects where you build and deploy generative‑AI applications on AWS.  You’ll practise prompt engineering, multi‑turn conversation handling, tool integration and content‑safety enforcement.
* **Optional: Deep‑dive workshop** – If you want a deeper live experience, the two‑day *Developing Generative AI Applications on AWS* workshop covers generative‑AI fundamentals, planning projects, Amazon Bedrock basics, prompt engineering and architecture patterns such as text summarization, question answering, chatbots and code generation{index=25}{index=26}{index=27}.  It also introduces LangChain integration for memory and agent pipelines{index=28}.

> **Badge or pick‑and‑choose?**  Hiring managers care more about your portfolio than an official badge.  Feel free to cherry‑pick modules that align with your interests—just be sure to complete enough projects to demonstrate proficiency.
