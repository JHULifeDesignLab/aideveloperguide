### Goal

Show that you can communicate risks, mitigate harm and document your solutions – just like a professional AI team.  AWS training emphasises that developers should **define the importance of generative AI, explain its potential risks and benefits, and identify business value**:contentReference[oaicite:29]{index=29}.  They must also **identify risks and mitigations when using generative AI**, understand the cost structure of Amazon Bedrock and design prompts that mitigate bias:contentReference[oaicite:30]{index=30}.

### Key practices

1. **Identify and mitigate risks** – Before deploying a model, list potential failure modes and misuse scenarios.  The objectives of the *Developing Generative AI Applications on AWS* course include discussing the technical foundations of generative AI, explaining the steps for planning a project and identifying risks and mitigation strategies:contentReference[oaicite:31]{index=31}:contentReference[oaicite:32]{index=32}.  Pay attention to cost implications and the importance of data protection and auditability:contentReference[oaicite:33]{index=33}.
2. **Apply prompt‑safety techniques** – Advanced prompt engineering modules teach developers to recognise misuses, analyse potential bias in foundation‑model responses and design prompts that mitigate that bias:contentReference[oaicite:34]{index=34}:contentReference[oaicite:35]{index=35}.  Practise zero‑shot and few‑shot prompts, chain‑of‑thought and function‑calling, and document how you address fairness, inclusivity and safety.
3. **Configure Bedrock Guardrails** – Amazon Bedrock Guardrails provides configurable safeguards for generative‑AI applications.  According to AWS engineers, guardrails offer six policies: **multimodal content filters**, **denied topics**, **sensitive information filters**, **word filters**, **contextual grounding checks** and **automated reasoning**:contentReference[oaicite:36]{index=36}.  These policies can be customised to maintain strong security controls and promote responsible use of AI:contentReference[oaicite:37]{index=37}.  Create a guardrail in the AWS console, enable harmful‑content and prompt‑attack filters, specify denied topics and word filters, and test the guardrail with sample prompts:contentReference[oaicite:38]{index=38}.
4. **Document your model** – A clear README or model card should describe the model’s purpose, data sources, training methods, evaluation metrics, limitations and safety filters.  The Bedrock foundation‑model documentation highlights data protection and auditability measures and demonstrates how to invoke models for text generation using secure APIs:contentReference[oaicite:39]{index=39}.  Include links to your guardrail configuration and risk assessments.
5. **Publish transparently** – Add your model card to your GitHub repository or application’s about page.  Being transparent about risks, mitigations and usage guidelines builds trust with users and employers.

> **Tip** – Responsible‑AI practices aren’t an afterthought; they’re part of the engineering process.  Bake them into your project from day one so you can clearly articulate trade‑offs and safeguards during interviews and code reviews.
