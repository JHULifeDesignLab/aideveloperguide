## Final Tips for Success
<CheckList>
  <CheckListItem>**Keep projects small and impactful:** Pick a narrow, useful task (e.g., “answer 50 common campus questions from 3 PDFs”).</CheckListItem>
  <CheckListItem>**Show your work publicly:** A GitHub repo + short LinkedIn post goes a long way; include a README screenshot or GIF.</CheckListItem>
  <CheckListItem>**Document limitations:** Use a Model Card or README section to explain intended use, risks, and guardrails.</CheckListItem>
  <CheckListItem>**Use relevant keywords:** Add “Amazon Bedrock,” “RAG,” “Guardrails,” “SageMaker Model Card,” and “Amazon Q Developer” where appropriate.</CheckListItem>
  <CheckListItem>**Ask for feedback:** Message an alum or TA with a 2–3 sentence note and a link to your project; iterate based on their advice.</CheckListItem>

> Hi ```Name```, I hope you're doing well. I saw that you're working with AWS AI services after graduating from my university. I'm a current student learning about machine learning on AWS and I recently built a small project using SageMaker. I'd love to hear any advice on breaking into the cloud AI industry or feedback on my approach to learning. Thanks and have a great day!

Customize your message depending on the person's background and your ask. Networking can provide insights that study materials won't – perhaps tips about certifications, or ideas for improving your projects.

### Ready for more challenges?
* **AWS Bedrock workshops:** Self‑paced labs for RAG, Agents, and prompt engineering — https://workshops.aws/categories/Amazon%20Bedrock  
* **Advanced prompt management:** Version and test prompts at scale — https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/implementing-advanced-prompt-engineering-with-amazon-bedrock/  
* **Skill Builder catalog (free courses):** https://aws.amazon.com/training/digital/
* AWS blog post series on [AI/ML best practices and case studies](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/)
* LinkedIn Learning courses are **free to JHU students**. Search for AWS Machine Learning courses at [linkedinlearning.jh.edu](https://linkedinlearning.jh.edu)

## Appendix A: AWS Project Ideas
Pick one, finish it, and document it well.

* **Campus FAQ Chatbot (RAG):** Create a Knowledge Base with a handful of campus PDFs and a website crawl; build a small web UI. ([Workshop](https://workshops.aws/card/bedrock), [Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/build-a-contextual-chatbot-application-using-knowledge-bases-for-amazon-bedrock/))
* **Long‑note Summarizer:** Summarize lecture notes with citations back to source paragraphs. Try multiple models via Bedrock to compare styles.
* **Syllabus Q&A Assistant:** Answer questions about due dates and policies by grounding to a course syllabus; include a “Show sources” toggle.
* **Support QnABot:** Start from the [AWS Solution and swap in Bedrock for answers](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/qnabot-on-aws/).  
* **Agent that runs simple tasks:** Use an Agent for Bedrock to call a weather or calendar API and return structured JSON back to your app.
* **Code‑generation assistant:** Experiment with Bedrock models capable of code generation. Build an agent that generates boilerplate code, then use guardrails to filter unsafe output.
* **Guardrail experimentation:** Set up a guardrail using Amazon Bedrock Guardrails and test the different policies. Create content‑filter and prompt‑attack policies, define denied topics and word filters, and test with sample prompts.

Each of these projects demonstrates different aspects of the AWS AI/ML ecosystem. They're excellent for learning because they expose you to various AWS services working together. As always, focus on understanding the architecture and making thoughtful service choices.

## Appendix B: Free Access & Pricing
* **[AWS Free Tier:](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)** Explore “always free” services; set billing alarms and delete resources after use
* **[AWS Educate (no credit card):](https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/  )** Beginner console + hands‑on labs
* **[SageMaker Studio Lab (free):](https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws/)** Hosted Jupyter for ML experimentation, make a free account
* **[Amazon Q Developer (Free Tier):](https://aws.amazon.com/q/developer/pricing/)** IDE and console assistant; understand limits before relying on it
