## Final Tips for Success
<CheckList>
    <CheckListItem>**Keep projects small and impactful:** It's better to fully complete a simple generative app (and understand it end-to-end) than to half-build something overly complex. Each project should have a clear goal (e.g. "analyze customer sentiment" or "automate document processing").</CheckListItem>
    <CheckListItem>**Showcase your work: Don't hide your projects!** Put them on GitHub, create a personal website or portfolio, and share on LinkedIn. A well-presented project can open doors ‚Äì recruiters often skim GitHub profiles and LinkedIn posts to gauge passion and initiative.</CheckListItem>
    <CheckListItem>**Document everything:** Use a README or even a simple Model Card for your projects to explain the what, why, and how. Good documentation not only reinforces your learning but also signals professionalism.</CheckListItem>
    <CheckListItem>**Use relevant tags and keywords:** When you publish projects or posts, tag them appropriately ‚Äì e.g. #AI, #AWS, #MachineLearning, #SageMaker, #Bedrock. This increases the visibility of your work.</CheckListItem>
    <CheckListItem>**Network and ask for feedback:** Connect with peers, alumni, and professionals who work in AI/ML. Let them know you're working towards AWS certifications and ask for advice or feedback on your approach.</CheckListItem>

> Hi ```Name```, I hope you're doing well. I saw that you're working with AWS AI services after graduating from my university. I'm a current student learning about machine learning on AWS and I recently built a small project using SageMaker. I'd love to hear any advice on breaking into the cloud AI industry or feedback on my approach to learning. Thanks and have a great day!

Customize your message depending on the person's background and your ask. Networking can provide insights that study materials won't ‚Äì perhaps tips about certifications, or ideas for improving your projects.

### Ready for more challenges?
* AWS blog post series on [AI/ML best practices and case studies](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/)
* LinkedIn Learning courses are **free to JHU students**. Search for AWS Machine Learning courses at [linkedinlearning.jh.edu](https://linkedinlearning.jh.edu)

## Appendix A ¬∑ AWS AI Project Ideas
To further guide your learning, here are some sample project ideas that use AWS AI/ML services like SageMaker, Bedrock, Comprehend, and more:

* **Text summarizer** ‚Äì Use Amazon Bedrock foundation models (e.g., Anthropic Claude or Amazon Titan) with LangChain to summarise long documents. Build a serverless API (e.g., AWS Lambda) that takes a PDF or web page and returns a concise summary.
* **Question‚Äëanswering with RAG** ‚Äì Implement a retrieval‚Äëaugmented generative (RAG) system by creating a knowledge base of your course notes. Use LangChain's retrievers and Bedrock's Knowledge Bases to answer questions about the material.
* **Chatbot with memory and agents** ‚Äì Combine Bedrock with LangChain to create a conversational interface that can remember context and call external tools. Extend with additional features like persona prompts or integration with Slack.
* **Code‚Äëgeneration assistant** ‚Äì Experiment with Bedrock models capable of code generation. Build an agent that generates boilerplate code, then use guardrails to filter unsafe output.
* **Guardrail experimentation** ‚Äì Set up a guardrail using Amazon Bedrock Guardrails and test the different policies. Create content‚Äëfilter and prompt‚Äëattack policies, define denied topics and word filters, and test with sample prompts.

<div className="bg-orange-50 rounded-lg p-6">
    <strong>Portfolio tip</strong> ‚Äì Focus on end-to-end AWS solutions that show your understanding of cloud architecture. Deploy using AWS services and document your infrastructure choices.
</div>

Each of these projects demonstrates different aspects of the AWS AI/ML ecosystem. They're excellent for learning because they expose you to various AWS services working together. As always, focus on understanding the architecture and making thoughtful service choices.

**Portfolio Tip:** Document your AWS architecture decisions and cost optimizations. Include architecture diagrams and explain why you chose specific services. This shows strategic thinking that employers value.

**Resume Tip:** Highlight your AWS service expertise. For example: "Built a serverless sentiment analysis pipeline using Amazon Comprehend, Lambda, and S3, processing 10K+ customer reviews with 95% accuracy."

Share your AWS projects on LinkedIn and tag them with relevant AWS hashtags. The AWS community is active and supportive of students showcasing their work.
