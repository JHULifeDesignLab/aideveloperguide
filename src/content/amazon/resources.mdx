## Final Tips for Success
<CheckList>
    <CheckListItem>**Keep projects small and impactful:** It's better to fully complete a simple generative app (and understand it end-to-end) than to half-build something overly complex. Each project should have a clear goal (e.g. "analyze customer sentiment" or "automate document processing").</CheckListItem>
    <CheckListItem>**Showcase your work: Don't hide your projects!** Put them on GitHub, create a personal website or portfolio, and share on LinkedIn. A well-presented project can open doors – recruiters often skim GitHub profiles and LinkedIn posts to gauge passion and initiative.</CheckListItem>
    <CheckListItem>**Document everything:** Use a README or even a simple Model Card for your projects to explain the what, why, and how. Good documentation not only reinforces your learning but also signals professionalism.</CheckListItem>
    <CheckListItem>**Use relevant tags and keywords:** When you publish projects or posts, tag them appropriately – e.g. #AI, #AWS, #MachineLearning, #SageMaker, #Bedrock. This increases the visibility of your work.</CheckListItem>
    <CheckListItem>**Network and ask for feedback:** Connect with peers, alumni, and professionals who work in AI/ML. Let them know you're working towards AWS certifications and ask for advice or feedback on your approach.</CheckListItem>

> Hi ```Name```, I hope you're doing well. I saw that you're working with AWS AI services after graduating from my university. I'm a current student learning about machine learning on AWS and I recently built a small project using SageMaker. I'd love to hear any advice on breaking into the cloud AI industry or feedback on my approach to learning. Thanks and have a great day!

Customize your message depending on the person's background and your ask. Networking can provide insights that study materials won't – perhaps tips about certifications, or ideas for improving your projects.

* LinkedIn Learning courses are **free to JHU students**. Search for AWS Machine Learning courses at [linkedinlearning.jh.edu](https://linkedinlearning.jh.edu)

## Appendix A · AWS AI Project Ideas
To further guide your learning, here are some sample project ideas that use AWS AI/ML services like SageMaker, Bedrock, Comprehend, and more:

* **Text summarizer** – Use Amazon Bedrock foundation models (e.g., Anthropic Claude or Amazon Titan) with LangChain to summarise long documents. Build a serverless API (e.g., AWS Lambda) that takes a PDF or web page and returns a concise summary.
* **Question‑answering with RAG** – Implement a retrieval‑augmented generative (RAG) system by creating a knowledge base of your course notes. Use LangChain's retrievers and Bedrock's Knowledge Bases to answer questions about the material.
* **Chatbot with memory and agents** – Combine Bedrock with LangChain to create a conversational interface that can remember context and call external tools. Extend with additional features like persona prompts or integration with Slack.
* **Code‑generation assistant** – Experiment with Bedrock models capable of code generation. Build an agent that generates boilerplate code, then use guardrails to filter unsafe output.
* **Guardrail experimentation** – Set up a guardrail using Amazon Bedrock Guardrails and test the different policies. Create content‑filter and prompt‑attack policies, define denied topics and word filters, and test with sample prompts.

    <strong>Portfolio tip</strong> – Focus on end-to-end AWS solutions that show your understanding of cloud architecture. Deploy using AWS services and document your infrastructure choices.
</div>

Each of these projects demonstrates different aspects of the AWS AI/ML ecosystem. They're excellent for learning because they expose you to various AWS services working together. As always, focus on understanding the architecture and making thoughtful service choices.

**Portfolio Tip:** Document your AWS architecture decisions and cost optimizations. Include architecture diagrams and explain why you chose specific services. This shows strategic thinking that employers value.

**Resume Tip:** Highlight your AWS service expertise. For example: "Built a serverless sentiment analysis pipeline using Amazon Comprehend, Lambda, and S3, processing 10K+ customer reviews with 95% accuracy."

Share your AWS projects on LinkedIn and tag them with relevant AWS hashtags. The AWS community is active and supportive of students showcasing their work.
