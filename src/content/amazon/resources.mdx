## Final Tips for Success
<CheckList>
  <CheckListItem>**Keep projects small and impactful:** Pick a narrow, useful task (e.g., “answer 50 common campus questions from 3 PDFs”).</CheckListItem>
  <CheckListItem>**Show your work publicly:** A GitHub repo + short LinkedIn post goes a long way; include a README screenshot or GIF.</CheckListItem>
  <CheckListItem>**Document limitations:** Use a Model Card or README section to explain intended use, risks, and guardrails.</CheckListItem>
  <CheckListItem>**Use relevant keywords:** Add “Amazon Bedrock,” “RAG,” “Guardrails,” “SageMaker Model Card,” and “Amazon Q Developer” where appropriate.</CheckListItem>
  <CheckListItem>**Ask for feedback:** Message an alum or TA with a 2–3 sentence note and a link to your project; iterate based on their advice.</CheckListItem>
</CheckList>

> Hi ```Name```, I hope you're doing well. I saw that you're working with AWS AI services after graduating from my university. I'm a current student learning about machine learning on AWS and I recently built a small project using SageMaker. I'd love to hear any advice on breaking into the cloud AI industry or feedback on my approach to learning. Thanks and have a great day!

Customize your message depending on the person's background and your ask. Networking can provide insights that study materials won't – perhaps tips about certifications, or ideas for improving your projects.

## Appendix A: AWS Project Ideas
Pick one, finish it, and document it well.

<details>
<summary><strong>Campus FAQ Chatbot (RAG)</strong></summary>

Build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot using Amazon Bedrock and Amazon Kendra for semantic search over crawled campus sites and uploaded PDFs. Deploy a lightweight web UI on AWS Amplify or Amazon S3 + CloudFront, and orchestrate the pipeline using AWS Lambda and API Gateway for scalable, serverless access.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Long‑note Summarizer</strong></summary>

Implement a document summarization service powered by Amazon Bedrock foundation models (Titan Text, Claude, or Llama 3) with citation tracing to the original source content. Manage text ingestion via Amazon S3, process with AWS Lambda, and store embeddings or structured outputs in Amazon OpenSearch Service for retrieval and comparison across model styles.
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appstudio/latest/userguide/tutorial-conversational-bedrock.html)
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Syllabus Q&A Assistant</strong></summary>

Develop a context-aware Q&A assistant that grounds answers to a syllabus document using Amazon Kendra for retrieval and Bedrock for generation. Incorporate Amazon API Gateway endpoints and a React-based UI with an optional “Show Sources” toggle powered by S3 pre-signed URLs for transparency and traceability.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Support QnABot</strong></summary>

Extend the AWS QnABot Solution on Amazon Lex by replacing its default response engine with Amazon Bedrock for richer, context-aware answers. Use Amazon DynamoDB for persistence, AWS Lambda for orchestration, and integrate with Amazon Connect or Slack to provide omnichannel support experiences (https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/qnabot-on-aws/), (https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/deploy-generative-ai-self-service-question-answering-using-the-qnabot-on-aws-solution-powered-by-amazon-lex-with-amazon-kendra-and-amazon-bedrock/)
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Agent that runs simple tasks</strong></summary>

Create an Agent for Amazon Bedrock capable of executing external tool calls through Lambda-based function integrations. Connect APIs like weather or calendar services, and structure the output in JSON for downstream processing. Employ Amazon CloudWatch for observability and IAM roles with least privilege to manage secure API invocation.
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agent-tutorial-step1.html)
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Code‑generation assistant</strong></summary>

Build a code-generation agent leveraging Amazon Bedrock’s Claude 3 Sonnet or CodeWhisperer APIs for intelligent code synthesis. Incorporate Guardrails for Bedrock to enforce output safety and use AWS Step Functions to orchestrate multi-step code-build workflows. Deploy securely within AWS Cloud9 or SageMaker Studio for interactive testing.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Guardrail experimentation</strong></summary>

Experiment with Guardrails for Amazon Bedrock to define content filters, topic restrictions, and safety guidelines for generative applications. Configure evaluation metrics in Amazon CloudWatch, manage policies through AWS Management Console, and test model behavior across varied prompt contexts to understand compliance and responsible-AI design in AWS environments.

</details>

Each of these projects demonstrates different aspects of the AWS AI/ML ecosystem. They're excellent for learning because they expose you to various AWS services working together. As always, focus on understanding the architecture and making thoughtful service choices.
