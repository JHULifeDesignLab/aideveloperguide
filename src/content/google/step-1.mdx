### Goal  
Build a rock-solid foundation in generative-AI concepts, tools, and ethics—*no prior AI experience required*.

### Core modules

1. **Introduction to Generative AI** (~45 min) – how text/image generators work and real-world use cases.  
2. **Introduction to Large Language Models (LLMs)** (~1 h) – prompt-tuning, attention, and hands-on PaLM/Vertex AI labs.  
3. **Introduction to Responsible AI** (~30 min) – Google AI Principles, fairness, safety, transparency.

### Optional labs (earn the Beginner Skill Badge)

4. **Prompt Design in Vertex AI** (~3 h 45 m) – single- & multimodal prompt engineering practice.  
5. **Responsible AI: Applying Principles with Google Cloud** (~2 h) – practical mitigation techniques and policy checks.

> **Tip** – These short courses give you just enough confidence before you tackle the deeper, 12-module developer path.
