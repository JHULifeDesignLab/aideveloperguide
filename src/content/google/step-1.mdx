# Step 1: Beginner: Introduction to Generative AI Learning Path 

## Goal  
**Goal:** Build a strong foundation in generative AI concepts, tools, and ethics—no prior experience required. 

Google Cloud offers a **free, beginner-friendly learning path** designed for software engineering students with **little or no background** in AI development. You’ll complete three short, engaging modules that introduce the key ideas behind generative AI, large language models, and responsible AI practices. To earn the skill badge, you’ll complete two more hands on steps which are more time intensive.  

Start here: [Beginner: Introduction to Generative AI Learning Path](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/paths/118)

## Core Modules

1. **Introduction to Generative AI** (~45 min) – Learn how generative models work, explore model types (like text and image generators), and see how they’re used in real-world applications.
2. **Introduction to Large Language Models (LLMs)** (~1 h) – Understand how LLMs generate text and how prompt tuning techniques (e.g. chain-of-thought prompts) shape their outputs.  
3. **Introduction to Responsible AI** (~30 min) – Explore why ethical AI is essential. You’ll learn about Google’s AI Principles and how fairness, safety, and transparency should guide development.

## Optional Labs (earn the Beginner Skill Badge, hands-on experience)
These modules are cool because you'll actually be given access to Google's tools and be able to interact with the software *free of cost*.

4. **Prompt Design in Vertex AI** (~3 h 45 m) – Practice designing prompts for both single- and multi-modal models using Google’s tools.
5. **Responsible AI: Applying Principles with Google Cloud** (~2 h) – Build on your foundation with practical steps for implementing ethical AI solutions.
