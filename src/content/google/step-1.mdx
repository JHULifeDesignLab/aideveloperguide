# Step 1: Beginner: Introduction to Generative AI Learning Path 

## Goal  
Build a strong foundation in generative AI concepts, tools, and ethics—no prior experience required. 

Google Cloud offers a **free, beginner-friendly learning path** designed for software engineering students with **little or no background** in AI development. You’ll complete three short, engaging modules that introduce the key ideas behind generative AI, large language models, and responsible AI practices. To earn the skill badge, you’ll complete two more hands on steps which are more time intensive.

## Core Modules

1. **Introduction to Generative AI** (~45 min) – Learn how generative models work, explore model types (like text and image generators), and see how they’re used in real-world applications.
2. **Introduction to Large Language Models (LLMs)** (~1 h) – Understand how LLMs generate text and how prompt tuning techniques (e.g. chain-of-thought prompts) shape their outputs.  
3. **Introduction to Responsible AI** (~30 min) – Explore why ethical AI is essential. You’ll learn about Google’s AI Principles and how fairness, safety, and transparency should guide development.

## Optional Labs (earn the Beginner Skill Badge, hands-on experience)
These modules are cool because you'll actually be given access to Google's tools and be able to interact with the software *free of cost*.

4. **Prompt Design in Vertex AI** (~3 h 45 m) – Practice designing prompts for both single- and multi-modal models using Google’s tools.
5. **Responsible AI: Applying Principles with Google Cloud** (~2 h) – Build on your foundation with practical steps for implementing ethical AI solutions.

Tip – These short courses give you just enough confidence before you tackle the deeper, 12-module developer path.

These courses are a great confidence-builder—especially if you're just getting started with AI or cloud platforms. You'll come away with a clearer understanding of what generative AI can do, how it's built and used, and how to apply it responsibly. This sets the stage for more advanced labs and hands-on projects in later steps.
