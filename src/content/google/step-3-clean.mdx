### Goal  
Show that you can **communicate risks and limitations** just like a professional AI team.

1. **Write a Model Card / README section** covering purpose, data, failure modes, and safety filters.  
2. **Explore the Model Context Protocol (MCP)** for standardized risk disclosures and user expectations.  
3. **Publish transparently**—add your documentation to GitHub or your app's "About" page.

A concise Model Card strengthens your résumé bullet or LinkedIn post ("Built a Q&A bot with PaLM 2 and documented scope & ethics").
