## Why focus on Generative AI?

Generative AI lets developers turn ideas into working features with only a few API calls to tools like Vertex AI, dramatically shortening the path from concept to deployment.

Recruiters aren't expecting deep expertise, but they do look for **initiative and hands-on projects** that show you can apply these models responsibly.
