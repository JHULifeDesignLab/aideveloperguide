## About
This guide is tailored for computer science undergraduates with limited Generative AI experience who want to build practical generative AI skills and earn the Google Skill Badge. It provides a clear, encouraging path from fundamentals to earning the Skill Badge, emphasizing hands-on projects and responsible AI practices. By following these steps, you'll gain experience with Google’s AI tools (like Vertex AI and PaLM) and create a portfolio that shows your curiosity and initiative to recruiters.  

**Skill Badge:** Google Cloud skill badges are digital credentials issued by Google Cloud in recognition of your knowledge of Google Cloud products and services. You can earn skill badges on Google Cloud Skills Boost and can share their skill badge to your social media profile and resume. Add manually as “License & Certifications” on LinkedIn or use [Credly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFAuWCEOxbw&t=392s), and add to your resume under Certification section. As noted, not all learning paths offer skill badges. 

**Do you really need a badge?** That’s for you to decide based on your goals. Most recruiters care far more about the project you create than a badge. Plus completing all the steps for a badge will take many hours of time. If your goal is to complete a project in a timely manner for your resume, then feel free to pick and choose which steps to complete in this document. You can always complete the badge later. 

## Why take the time to build these skills?
In the hypercompetitive tech job market, it is important to ensure that you are doing everything that you can to stand out as an applicant. By taking the time to build projects using recent advances in generative AI technology, you demonstrate new competencies aligned with software engineering job requirements. By taking the time to achieve skill badges and certifications, you showcase curiosity and the ambition to go above and beyond your coursework. 
### Why GenAI?
From a software developer’s perspective, the key difference between traditional AI/ML and generative AI is what the model produces. Conventional machine learning models are designed to analyze data — they classify, detect, or predict based on patterns in existing datasets. For example, predicting housing prices or recognizing whether an image contains a cat. 

Generative AI goes a step further: it creates. These models generate entirely new content—text, images, code, music—by learning from vast amounts of data. **That means developers aren’t just building systems that analyze information—they’re building systems that create it.** Large language models (LLMs), diffusion models, and multimodal transformers can now write essays, generate front-end code from prompts, design images, or simulate dynamic conversations. 

This unlocks a new class of applications—and development becomes faster and more flexible. Instead of spending weeks writing boilerplate or tuning algorithms from scratch, you can prototype working features with just a few API calls to tools like Google’s Vertex AI or OpenAI’s APIs. It is important to understand both the concepts behind these tools and how to use them. 

___Generative AI is a game changer___ because it dramatically shortens the path from idea to implementation. Learning how to use these models isn't just optional—it’s essential if you want to stay competitive in today’s rapidly evolving software landscape. Recruiters for entry-level roles aren’t expecting you to be a generative AI expert, but they do look for initiative, coding ability, and hands-on project experience. By following this generative AI learning path, you’ll be able to: 
* **Showcase Industry Tools:** Gain experience with cloud-based AI platforms widely used in the field (e.g., Google Cloud’s Vertex AI). 
* **Build Transferable Skills:** Learn how to use APIs, deploy apps to the cloud, and document your work—skills that apply across software roles. 
* **Demonstrate Responsible AI Practices:** Stand out by applying ethical AI principles and clearly communicating your models’ intended use, limitations, and risks. 

## What about the Google Machine Learning (ML) Certification?
[ML is a subset of AI.](https://cloud.google.com/learn/artificial-intelligence-vs-machine-learning?hl=en) While both machine learning (ML) and generative AI fall under the broader umbrella of artificial intelligence, they serve different roles in software development. ML typically refers to building models that analyze data and make decisions or predictions—like recommending movies, detecting fraud, or forecasting demand. Generative AI, on the other hand, creates new content such as text, images, or code. This creative power opens exciting new possibilities, but it also introduces complex ethical challenges. For instance, generative models can "hallucinate" inaccurate information, reinforce harmful biases in training data, or be misused to generate deceptive content. That’s why responsible AI practices—like documenting how a model should be used, applying safety filters, and setting clear usage boundaries—are crucial. As you build generative AI projects, you're not just learning technical skills; you're also developing ethical awareness and a sense of accountability—traits that matter deeply to employers and society alike.

After completing the steps in this document, a natural next step for students aiming to deepen their AI and ML credentials is to explore the [Google Cloud Professional Machine Learning Engineer Certification](https://cloud.google.com/learn/certification/machine-learning-engineer/). This advanced certification validates your ability to design, build, and productionize ML models on Google Cloud — skills that go beyond using pre-trained generative models and into custom training, data pipelines, and real-world deployment. While Google recommends three or more years of industry experience (including at least one year of designing ML solutions on Google Cloud), motivated students who have completed coursework in ML, built several projects, and gained hands-on practice with tools like Vertex AI and TensorFlow may benefit from beginning the preparation process early. Simply reviewing the [exam guide](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/professional_machine_learning_engineer_exam_guide_english.pdf) and practice resources can help identify knowledge gaps and chart a longer-term learning path toward professional-level AI development skills that go beyond using pre-trained generative models and into custom training, data pipelines, and real-world deployment.


## Three-step Roadmap
This guide suggests four steps to follow to get the most out of the Google Learning Path and to improve your resume experience beyond earning the skills badge. You’ll start with foundational learning, complete the Learning Path to earn skill badge, and lastly learn a responsible approach to Generative AI development.  

___Tip for First-Time Google Cloud Users:___ Be sure to register a Cloud Skills Boost account and sign in before launching any lab. Some labs require enabling temporary credentials, and progress won’t be tracked unless you’re signed in.
