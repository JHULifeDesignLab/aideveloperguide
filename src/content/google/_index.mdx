## Why focus on Generative AI?

Generative AI lets developers turn ideas into working features with only a few API calls to tools like Vertex AI, dramatically shortening the path from concept to deployment.

Recruiters aren’t expecting deep expertise, but they do look for **initiative and hands-on projects** that show you can apply these models responsibly.

## Three-step roadmap

| Step | Outcome |
|------|---------|
| **Step 1 – Beginner Foundation** | Complete three bite-sized intro modules (plus two optional labs) to grasp LLM basics and Responsible AI. |
| **Step 2 – Developer Path & Skill Badge** | Finish the 12-module “Generative AI for Developers” path (~26 h) and earn an optional Google Cloud Skill Badge. |
| **Step 3 – Responsible AI Documentation** | Create Model Cards / MCP docs that communicate model limits and risks—an industry-ready portfolio signal. |
