## Final Tips for Success
<CheckList>
    <CheckListItem>**Keep projects small and impactful:** It’s better to fully complete a simple generative app (and understand it end-to-end) than to half-build something overly complex. Each project should have a clear goal (e.g. “summarize news articles” or “generate meal recipes from ingredients”).</CheckListItem>
    <CheckListItem>**Showcase your work: Don’t hide your projects!** Put them on GitHub, create a personal website or portfolio, and share on LinkedIn. A well-presented project can open doors – recruiters often skim GitHub profiles and LinkedIn posts to gauge passion and initiative.</CheckListItem>
    <CheckListItem>**Document everything:** Use a README or even a simple Model Card for your projects to explain the what, why, and how. Good documentation not only reinforces your learning (and readiness for exam questions on generative AI documentation) but also signals professionalism.</CheckListItem>
    <CheckListItem>**Use relevant tags and keywords:** When you publish projects or posts, tag them appropriately – e.g. #AI, #VertexAI, #GoogleCloud, #GenerativeAI. This increases the visibility of your work. (If you did something with multi-agent systems or a specific new protocol like A2A or MCP, you can tag that too, but only if it’s actually part of your project.)</CheckListItem>
    <CheckListItem>**Network and ask for feedback:** Connect with peers, alumni, and professionals who work in AI/ML. Let them know you’re working towards this certification and ask for advice or feedback on your approach. People are often willing to help a student eager to learn. A polite message can go a long way. For example, you might reach out to an alumnus on LinkedIn or OneHop:</CheckListItem>
        >Hi ```Name```, I hope you’re doing well. I saw that you’re working in AI/ML after graduating from my university. I’m a current student learning about generative AI and I recently built a small project using Vertex AI. I’d love to hear any advice on breaking into the AI industry or feedback on my approach to learning. Thanks and have a great day!

    Customize your message depending on the person’s background and your ask. Networking can provide insights that study materials won’t – perhaps tips about the exam, or ideas for improving your projects. Plus, these connections might alert you to internship or job opportunities down the line.

## Appendix A · Sample project ideas

* **Long-document summarizer** using PaLM Text-Bison and Vertex AI Codelab.  
* **Document Q&A chatbot with RAG** (LangChain ➜ Vertex AI Vector Search).  
* **Imagen image-generation web app** served from Model Garden.  
* **Contextual Chatbot (Chat-Bison)** with persona prompts.  
* **Autonomous browsing agent**—DeepLearning.AI short course walks you through it.

> **Portfolio tip** – One fully-working, well-documented project beats an ambitious half-finished idea. Deploy it on Cloud Run and showcase it on GitHub with screenshots and a clear README.

### Bonus – Git & portfolio hygiene

*Turn your GitHub profile into a mini-site by creating a repo named after your username and adding a custom README.* This is a recruiter-magnet showcase.
