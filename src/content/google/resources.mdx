## Final Tips for Success
<CheckList>
    <CheckListItem>**Keep projects small and impactful:** It's better to fully complete a simple generative app (and understand it end-to-end) than to half-build something overly complex. Each project should have a clear goal (e.g. "summarize news articles" or "generate meal recipes from ingredients").</CheckListItem>
    <CheckListItem>**Showcase your work: Don't hide your projects!** Put them on GitHub, create a personal website or portfolio, and share on LinkedIn. A well-presented project can open doors – recruiters often skim GitHub profiles and LinkedIn posts to gauge passion and initiative.</CheckListItem>
    <CheckListItem>**Document everything:** Use a README or even a simple Model Card for your projects to explain the what, why, and how. Good documentation not only reinforces your learning (and readiness for exam questions on generative AI documentation) but also signals professionalism.</CheckListItem>
    <CheckListItem>**Use relevant tags and keywords:** When you publish projects or posts, tag them appropriately – e.g. #AI, #VertexAI, #GoogleCloud, #GenerativeAI. This increases the visibility of your work. (If you did something with multi-agent systems or a specific new protocol like A2A or MCP, you can tag that too, but only if it's actually part of your project.)</CheckListItem>
    <CheckListItem>**Network and ask for feedback:** Connect with peers, alumni, and professionals who work in AI/ML. Let them know you're working towards this certification and ask for advice or feedback on your approach. People are often willing to help a student eager to learn. A polite message can go a long way. For example, you might reach out to an alumnus on LinkedIn or OneHop:</CheckListItem>
</CheckList>

> Hi ```Name```, I hope you're doing well. I saw that you're working in AI/ML after graduating from my university. I'm a current student learning about generative AI and I recently built a small project using Vertex AI. I'd love to hear any advice on breaking into the AI industry or feedback on my approach to learning. Thanks and have a great day!

Customize your message depending on the person's background and your ask. Networking can provide insights that study materials won't – perhaps tips about the exam, or ideas for improving your projects. Plus, these connections might alert you to internship or job opportunities down the line.

## Appendix A · Google AI Project Ideas
To further guide your learning, here are some sample project ideas (with resources) that exclusively use Google's generative AI offerings like PaLM API, Vertex AI Studio, Model Garden, etc. Each project includes a brief description and a link to a tutorial or code: 

* **Long Document Summarizer (Text-Bison Model):** Use the PaLM Text Bison model via Vertex AI to summarize long texts or PDF documents. This project involves breaking a document into chunks and summarizing each part, then refining the results – a strategy to handle model input length limits. Tutorial: [Google Codelab on Text Summarization with Vertex AI](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/vertex-ai-summarization) walks you through multiple methods (like "MapReduce") to generate concise summaries from large documents. 
* **Document Q&A Chatbot with Retrieval:** Build a chatbot that can answer questions based on your own documents (like class notes, research papers, or manuals). This project introduces you to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)—a popular technique that grounds a model's output in real data to improve accuracy and reduce hallucinations. You'll learn how to split documents into chunks, generate embeddings, store them in a vector database, and retrieve relevant text for a user's query before passing it to a language model.
    * **Tutorial:** [LangChain RAG Tutorial](https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/rag/) – a beginner-friendly walkthrough that runs locally or in Colab, Google's free cloud-based coding environment for Python (no installation required). Once you understand the basics, you can apply the same RAG pipeline using [Vertex AI Vector Search](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/vector-search/overview) (formerly Matching Engine) for scalable, production-level retrieval on Google Cloud.
* **Image Generation Web App (Imagen Model):** Develop a web application where users input a description and the app returns an AI-generated image. This leverages Google's Imagen model available through [Vertex AI's Model Garden](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-garden/explore-models). You can call the Vertex AI API with a text prompt to generate an image (e.g. "a medieval city skyline at sunset"). The official documentation shows how to use the Imagen model via the console or Python API, and Google has a Colab notebook for image generation that you can reference for code. This project is a great way to learn about prompt design for image models and how to handle the image data returned by the API. 
* **Contextual Chatbot (Chat-Bison Model):** Create a chatbot that behaves in a specific way or domain, using the PaLM Chat-Bison model. For example, a "Coding Helper Chatbot" that answers programming questions, or a "History Tutor" that speaks in Shakespearean English. Using Vertex AI's ChatModel, you can define a context (system prompt) to set the bot's persona and provide a few example Q&A pairs to guide its style. This project will teach you how to steer a generative model's outputs.
    * **Tutorial:** See InfoWorld's guide ["Build a chatbot with Google's PaLM API"](https://www.infoworld.com/article/2338790/build-a-chatbot-with-google-palm-api.html) for a step-by-step example of creating a custom chatbot using the Vertex AI PaLM SDK. 
* **Autonomous Web Browsing Agent:** Develop an AI agent that uses generative models to navigate websites and perform multi-step tasks like scraping data, summarizing content, or filling out forms automatically. This project shows how LLMs can go beyond text generation to interact with real-world web applications.
    * **Tutorial:** DeepLearning.AI's free short course ["Building AI Browser Agents"](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/building-ai-browser-agents/) provides step-by-step guidance on constructing and improving such web agents. 
* **Text Summarizer with PaLM API & Vertex AI:** Use Google's PaLM language model to condense long articles or PDFs into brief summaries. This could be a simple Python script or web app that calls the Vertex AI API to summarize text. (Google provides a [codelab on summarization techniques](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/text-summ-large-docs-stuffing) to help you get started.)

    <strong>Portfolio tip</strong> – One fully-working, well-documented project beats an ambitious half-finished idea. Deploy it on Cloud Run and showcase it on GitHub with screenshots and a clear README.
</div>

Each of these projects uses Google's generative AI tools and comes with community or official guidance. They are excellent for learning because they expose you to different facets of generative AI (text, images, retrieval, conversation). As always, when following a tutorial, don't just copy code – try to understand it and experiment with tweaks. Often, it can be easy to passively learn these new concepts. Make sure that you're understanding every line of code- whether this is trying to build your own project and not following a tutorial, or having ChatGPT or Copilot explain every line of code. 

If none of these projects interest you, ask a generative model of your choosing to give you a plan and resources to create a topic of your choosing. An example prompt may be:
> I think that the big things that I am missing from my resume are R and SQL can you please give me a project that I could do for my resume that would help me hone in on these two skills? In particular, something that will pop for finance/consulting/swe and is different from the LOB simulation that I am also working on. Thank you very much!

Focus on completing one project that you can fully understand and explain during an interview. These are tangible projects that YOU built to highlight your Generative AI development capabilities. It's better to have a simple working app than an ambitious half-finished one. As you build, make sure to use Google's tools (Vertex AI Workbench notebooks, Cloud Run for deployment, etc.) so you become comfortable with the ecosystem. For instance, you might deploy your text summarizer as a Flask app on Cloud Run or host your image generator on a simple web server. 

**Portfolio Tip:** Put your code on GitHub and include a README describing the project. Even a small project can shine if it's well-documented. Consider deploying it and adding a screenshot or demo GIF in the README. ChatGPT is great for generating these- consider asking to generate one in the same thread you may be consulting as you build your project so that the model has appropriate context. You can also enable search mode and paste the link to your repository to give the model good context to generate a better README.

**Resume Tip:** Add a bullet point highlighting what you built and which technologies you used. For example: "Built a web app that generates image captions using Vertex AI's PaLM API and deployed it on Cloud Run; documented model limitations with a Model Card." This shows practical skills (web dev, API usage) and awareness of responsible AI. 

Lastly, post about your project! Share a screenshot and a brief description of what you learned. Use hashtags like #GoogleCloud, #VertexAI, and #GenerativeAI to reach others in the community. Employers notice candidates who take initiative to learn and build things. By adding one of these projects to your portfolio (or taking inspiration to design your own), you'll be well on your way to becoming a skilled generative AI developer.
