## Appendix A · Sample project ideas

* **Long-document summarizer** using PaLM Text-Bison and Vertex AI Codelab.  
* **Document Q&A chatbot with RAG** (LangChain ➜ Vertex AI Vector Search).  
* **Imagen image-generation web app** served from Model Garden.  
* **Contextual Chatbot (Chat-Bison)** with persona prompts.  
* **Autonomous browsing agent**—DeepLearning.AI short course walks you through it.

> **Portfolio tip** – One fully-working, well-documented project beats an ambitious half-finished idea. Deploy it on Cloud Run and showcase it on GitHub with screenshots and a clear README.
