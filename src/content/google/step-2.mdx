# Step 2: Google Generative AI for Developers Learning Path and Earn Skill Badge 

## Goal  
Complete Google’s [Generative AI for Developers Learning Path](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/paths/183) and earn skill badge (12 modules, 26 hours).

**Tip:** Depending on your goals, complete the steps you need to start on independent project or complete all the steps to earn the skill badge.  

This technical, hands-on path is designed for developers and includes both courses and labs. You’ll get experience with crucial topics like image generation, attention mechanisms, encoder-decoder models, and transformers – all foundational for understanding how modern generative models work. Importantly, this path gives you access to Vertex AI Studio and Model Garden through guided labs, so you can try out Google’s PaLM 2 models (for text, chat, code, etc.) and even image generation models in a real environment. 

<ResumeTip title="Resumé Item: Finished Google Cloud’s multistage generative‑AI learning path and built prototype apps." variant="success">
Finished Google Cloud’s multistage generative‑AI learning path and built prototype apps. Worked through the official learning path’s five core activities to gain a systematic understanding of generative AI—from fundamentals of large language models to responsible‑AI principles. The program’s beginner‑friendly yet comprehensive modules and hands‑on exercises allowed me to build and iterate on prototype apps, reinforcing theoretical knowledge with practical experience.

As you go through the labs, The Google Learning Path validates your ability to develop and implement generative AI models using Google’s technology. In practice, that means you should be comfortable with:
* **Core Generative Models:** Understand how models like transformers, large language models, and diffusion models work, as well as earlier generative approaches (autoencoders, GANs) for tasks like image generation and translation. You don’t need to derive equations but know the key concepts (e.g. what is attention? how do GANs differ from diffusion models?). 
* **Implementing AI Solutions:** Be familiar with training or fine-tuning models and the basics of frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch. The exam may not require writing code from scratch, but you should recognize code snippets and understand the workflow of building and deploying an ML model. Hands-on labs or coursework in your ML classes will help here. 
* **Google Cloud’s AI Offerings:** Memorize what generative AI services Google Cloud provides and when to use them. For example, know the purpose of the PaLM API, Vertex AI’s Model Garden (pre-trained models), Generative AI Studio (for prompt prototyping), and tools like Vertex AI Matching Engine (for similarity search in retrieval-augmented generation). Expect questions on which tool is appropriate for a given scenario (e.g. “How to quickly prototype a generative model solution?” -> Vertex AI Studio). 
* **Optimizing Model Outputs:** Learn techniques for improving generative AI results, such as prompt engineering, adjusting temperature/top-k settings for text models, and grounding model outputs with external data. For instance, you encountered prompt design first-hand in the labs. Understand concepts like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) – e.g., using the Matching Engine to provide documents to the model as context. These strategies help overcome limitations like hallucinations. 
* **Responsible AI and Ethics:** Be prepared for questions on detecting and mitigating bias, privacy considerations, and AI safety. Google expects certified developers to know best practices for responsible AI use. This could include knowledge of *Google’s AI Principles* and how to apply them (for example, avoiding problematic use cases, or ensuring user data is handled safely when building generative apps). 

Finally, continue building on your project work: if you have time, implement a second project or add a new feature to your first one (e.g. add a chatbot interface to your text summarizer). Reference [Appendix A](./resources) for project ideas.
