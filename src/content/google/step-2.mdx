### Goal  
Finish Google's **Generative AI for Developers** learning path (12 modules, ~26 hours) and *optionally* earn the Skill Badge.

The path mixes theory and labs so you can:

* Experiment with **transformers, diffusion, encoder–decoder models**.  
* Practice fine-tuning and **TensorFlow/PyTorch** workflows you'll meet in interviews.  
* Get comfortable with **Vertex AI Studio, Model Garden, and Matching Engine** for RAG workflows.

> **Badge or pick-and-choose?** Recruiters care more about the project you build than the badge itself, so feel free to cherry-pick modules aligned with your portfolio goals.
