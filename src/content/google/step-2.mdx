## Goal  
Complete Google’s [Generative AI for Developers Learning Path](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/paths/183) and earn skill badge (12 modules, 26 hours).

The path mixes theory and labs so you can:

* Experiment with **transformers, diffusion, encoder–decoder models**.  
* Practice fine-tuning and **TensorFlow/PyTorch** workflows you'll meet in interviews.  
* Get comfortable with **Vertex AI Studio, Model Garden, and Matching Engine** for RAG workflows.

    <em>Badge or pick-and-choose?</em> Recruiters care more about the project you build than the badge itself, so feel free to cherry-pick modules aligned with your portfolio goals.
