# Step 1: Beginner: Introduction to Generative AI Learning Path 

## Goal  
Build a strong foundation in generative AI concepts, tools, and ethics—no prior experience required.

Microsoft Learn provides a **beginner-friendly onramp** to the Azure generative AI stack. In this step you’ll:
<ol type="a">
    <li>understand GenAI at a practical developer level</li>
    <li>get oriented in **Azure AI Foundry** (formerly Azure AI Studio) and **Azure OpenAI**</li>
    <li>become familiar with Microsoft's Content Safety framework</li>
</ol>

This path is designed for aspiring SWE/AI interns who need real, runnable artifacts. By the end, you’ll be able to deploy a model in Azure AI Foundry, call it from a simple app, and add **content safety** guardrails. You’ll also know the basic vocabulary you’ll be asked about in screens and interviews (prompting, grounding/RAG, embeddings, safety, evals).

### What you should aim to be comfortable with
* **Core Generative Models:** What LLMs do; prompting basics; modalities (text, image).  
* **Implementing AI Solutions on Azure:** Deploying a model, calling REST/SDK from a small app, basic cost/safety controls.  
* **Azure GenAI Offerings:** Where to find models, how to deploy/test in **Azure AI Foundry**, and how **Azure OpenAI** fits in.  
* **Optimizing Outputs:** System messages, few-shot examples, parameters; basic evaluation habits.  
* **Responsible AI & Safety:** When and how to integrate **Azure AI Content Safety**; logging limits/risks clearly in your README.

## Core Modules
1. **GenAI refresher & prompt engineering**
- Skim Microsoft’s [Introduction to generative AI concepts (36 minute, pass designation)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/fundamentals-generative-ai/) for quick intuition.
    - Note: you can just quickly look through these resources, but if you work through this module you can get a *pass designation* on your profile.
- Practice system/user messages and few-shot prompting in a notebook or the Foundry playground.
    - [Create effective prompts for generative AI training tools (20 minutes, pass designation)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/create-prompts-for-generative-ai-training-tools/)
    - [System message design (article)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/concepts/advanced-prompt-engineering)
    - [Prompt engineering techniques (article)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/concepts/prompt-engineering?tabs=chat)
    - [Here](https://ai.azure.com/catalog) are the available models in Azure Foundry
- Apply prompt engineering with [Azure OpenAI Service (learn module, 7h29, hands-on experience)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/create-custom-copilots-ai-studio/)

2. **Azure AI Foundry fast start (model catalog, deployments):** Create a Foundry project; browse the model catalog; deploy a chat model; send a test prompt in the playground.
- Learn about [what Azure AI Foundry is](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/what-is-azure-ai-foundry) and check out [available models](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/concepts/foundry-models-overview)
- Resources for building and deploying your first model:
    - [Create a resource and deploy a model (Microsoft's step-by-step guide)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/how-to/create-resource?pivots=web-portal)
    - [YouTube - Azure AI Foundry | Introduction & Hands-on Demo (42 minutes)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2BWayItOv4)

3. **Responsible AI checkpoint:** Learn about how Microsoft approaches responsible AI
- [What is Azure AI Content Safety? (article)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/content-safety/overview)
- Use [Azure AI Content Safety documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/content-safety/) throughout the rest of this guide to implement proper protocols.
- [Responsible AI for Azume OpenAI (overview)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/responsible-ai/openai/overview)

<strong>Bonus:</strong> if you already completed the Google or Amazon path, how do their responsible AI practices differ from Microsoft's?
</div>

## Optional Labs (earn the Beginner Skill Badge, hands-on experience)
- Do 1–2 **Applied Skills**/Learn modules tied to Azure OpenAI basics, RAG-on-your-data quickstarts, or prompt flow/evals.  
- Screenshots + short write-ups go into your portfolio and LinkedIn.
