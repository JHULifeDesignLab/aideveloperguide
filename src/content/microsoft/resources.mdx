## Final Tips for Success
<CheckList>
    <CheckListItem>**Keep projects small and impactful:** It's better to fully complete a simple generative app (and understand it end-to-end) than to half-build something overly complex. Each project should have a clear goal (e.g. "automate customer support" or "enhance productivity").</CheckListItem>
    <CheckListItem>**Showcase your work: Don't hide your projects!** Put them on GitHub, create a personal website or portfolio, and share on LinkedIn. A well-presented project can open doors ‚Äì recruiters often skim GitHub profiles and LinkedIn posts to gauge passion and initiative.</CheckListItem>
    <CheckListItem>Write a short **‚Äúintended use & limits‚Äù** section for every demo.</CheckListItem>
    <CheckListItem>**Use relevant tags and keywords:** When you publish projects or posts, tag them appropriately ‚Äì e.g. #AI, #Azure, #MachineLearning, #CognitiveServices, #OpenAI. This increases the visibility of your work.</CheckListItem>
    <CheckListItem>Keep a tiny **eval set** (evaluation dataset- collection of data samples used to assess the performance and capabilities of an AI application or trained ML model) and re-run it after major changes.</CheckListItem>
    <CheckListItem>Track **costs/latency** so you can answer ‚Äúhow much and how fast‚Äù in interviews.</CheckListItem>
    <CheckListItem>**Network and ask for feedback:** Connect with peers, alumni, and professionals who work in AI/ML. Let them know you're working towards Microsoft certifications and ask for advice or feedback on your approach. See an example below.</CheckListItem>

> Hi ```Name```, I hope you're doing well. I saw that you're working with Microsoft AI technologies after graduating from my university. I'm a current student learning about Azure AI services and I recently built a small project using Azure OpenAI. I'd love to hear any advice on breaking into the enterprise AI industry or feedback on my approach to learning. Thanks and have a great day!

Customize your message depending on the person's background and your ask. Networking can provide insights that study materials won't ‚Äì perhaps tips about certifications, or ideas for improving your projects.

Each of these projects demonstrates different aspects of Microsoft's AI ecosystem. They're excellent for learning because they expose you to enterprise-grade AI services and Microsoft's approach to responsible AI. Focus on understanding how to integrate multiple services effectively.

**Portfolio Tip:** Highlight your understanding of Microsoft's AI principles and responsible AI practices. Document your approach to bias mitigation, privacy protection, and ethical AI considerations.

**Resume Tip:** Emphasize your Microsoft ecosystem expertise. For example: "Built an intelligent document processing system using Azure AI Document Intelligence and OpenAI, reducing manual processing time by 75% while maintaining 99% accuracy."

Share your Microsoft AI projects on LinkedIn and tag them with relevant Microsoft hashtags. The Microsoft developer community is very active and supportive of students.
