### Goal

Master hands-on development with Azure AI services. Build real-world applications using Azure OpenAI Service, integrate with other Azure AI services, and learn to create enterprise-ready AI solutions that follow Microsoft's best practices for security, scalability, and performance.

### Core development areas

1. **Azure OpenAI Service Development** – Learn to integrate OpenAI models into applications using REST APIs and SDKs. Practice with different model types (GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Codex) and understand how to optimize for performance and cost.

2. **Azure AI Studio & Cognitive Services** – Explore the broader Azure AI ecosystem including Computer Vision, Speech Services, Language Understanding, and Document Intelligence. Learn how to combine multiple AI services for comprehensive solutions.

3. **Copilot Development** – Understand how to build custom Copilot experiences and extensions. Learn about the Microsoft Graph API integration and how to create AI-powered productivity tools.

4. **Enterprise Integration Patterns** – Study common architectural patterns for integrating AI into enterprise applications. Learn about authentication, security, monitoring, and scaling considerations.

### Hands-on projects

Build practical experience through projects such as:
- **Intelligent Document Processing** using Azure AI Document Intelligence
- **Custom Chatbot** with Azure OpenAI and Bot Framework
- **Code Assistant** using Codex models
- **Multi-modal AI Application** combining vision and language services

### Learning outcomes

After completing this step, you will be able to:
- Develop applications using Azure OpenAI Service
- Integrate multiple Azure AI services effectively
- Follow enterprise development best practices
- Deploy AI solutions to Azure cloud infrastructure

> **Focus Area** – Emphasize building production-ready applications. Microsoft's enterprise focus means your solutions should be scalable, secure, and maintainable from day one.
