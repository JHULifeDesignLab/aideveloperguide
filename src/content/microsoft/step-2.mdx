# Step 2: Microsoft Generative AI for Developers Learning Path and Earn Applied Skills 

## Goal  
Ship a small **RAG-backed chat app** that runs against your own documents using **Azure AI Search** + **Azure OpenAI**, built and iterated in **Azure AI Foundry**.
Keep scope tight (one use case, < 10 files).
Add **Azure AI Content Safety** filters and a simple evaluation checklist (answer grounded? cites supplied? latency/cost acceptable?).
If time aligns, validate your skills with an **Applied Skills** assessment or Learn path that covers deployment, RAG, and responsible AI.
