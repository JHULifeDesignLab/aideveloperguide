# Step 2: Azure AI Project or AI Engineer Path

## Option A: Azure AI Project
This step is to help you gain hands-on experience (and hopefully a resumé bullet) using Microsoft's tools.
* Keep the scope of the project tight (one use case, < 10 files).
* For example, you may want to build a study-buddy for a class that you've taken.
* Add **Azure AI Content Safety** filters and a simple evaluation checklist (answer grounded? cites supplied? latency/cost acceptable?).
* If time aligns, validate your skills with an **Applied Skills** assessment or Learn path that covers deployment, RAG, and responsible AI.

<ResumeTip title="" variant="success">
Followed the Azure AI Foundry learning path: planned AI solutions, chose and deployed models from the Foundry catalogue, built an app using the Azure AI Foundry SDK, used prompt‑flow to develop language‑model apps, implemented retrieval‑augmented generation using indexed data, fine‑tuned a base language model for chat‑completion tasks, added responsible‑AI safeguards and evaluated performance using Azure AI Studio tools.

1. Walkthrough: [Get started with Azure AI Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/quickstarts/get-started-code?utm_source=chatgpt.com&tabs=azure-ai-foundry&pivots=fdp-project)
2. New vocab: Learn about [Azure OpenAI "On Your Data"](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/concepts/use-your-data?utm_source=chatgpt.com&tabs=ai-search%2Ccopilot)
    * This is the feature that will allow you to train a model using *your own files*
3. Choose one of the following small projects to build:
    * Build a small conversational model with your own data by [following this tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/use-your-data-quickstart?utm_source=chatgpt.com&tabs=keyless%2Ctypescript-keyless%2Cpython-new&pivots=ai-foundry-portal)

You can also use [GitHub Models](https://docs.github.com/en/github-models/use-github-models/prototyping-with-ai-models?) free of cost.

## Option B: Microsoft Learning Paths
If you are looking to complete one of Microsoft's learning paths instead (or in addition to) there are four learning paths for AI:
* [Implement knowledge mining with Azure AI Search](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/implement-knowledge-mining-azure-cognitive-search/?WT.mc_id=portaledu_inproduct_roles) **(8 modules, 6.5 hr)**: Implement knowledge mining with Azure AI Search
* [Create machine learning models](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/create-machine-learn-models/?WT.mc_id=portaledu_inproduct_roles) **(5 modules, 6 hours)**: Learn some of the core principles of machine learning and how to use common tools and frameworks to train, evaluate, and use machine learning models.
* [Understand data science for machine learning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/understand-machine-learning/?WT.mc_id=portaledu_inproduct_roles) **(9 modules, 7.5 hr)**: This learning path is a high-level introduction to machine learning for people with little or no knowledge of computer science or statistics.
* [Introduction to AI in Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/introduction-to-ai-on-azure/?WT.mc_id=portaledu_inproduct_roles) **(12 modules, 8.5 hr)**: This course introduces core concepts related to artificial intelligence (AI), and the services in Microsoft Azure that can be used to create AI solutions.


You have the option to get a certificate. None of the authors of this guide have taken a MS certificate assessment, but from research, it apepars that exams are proctored (either in-person or online).
We continue to emphasize that the experience is more important than a badge! Do not let this be your deciding factor of whether or not to take the course.
