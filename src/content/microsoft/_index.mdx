## Why build with Microsoft Azure AI?

Microsoft Azure provides a comprehensive AI platform with **Azure OpenAI Service**, **Azure AI Studio**, and enterprise-grade **Copilot** integrations. These services enable developers to build intelligent applications using the latest foundation models while maintaining enterprise security, compliance, and governance standards. Microsoft's approach emphasizes responsible AI development with built-in safety features, content filtering, and comprehensive monitoring capabilities.

## Three‑step roadmap

| Step | Outcome |
|------|---------|
| **Step 1 – AI Fundamentals** | Build foundational knowledge of AI concepts, Azure's AI services ecosystem, and responsible AI principles. Learn core terminology, understand Azure OpenAI Service capabilities, and explore enterprise AI considerations. |
| **Step 2 – Azure AI Development** | Master hands-on development with Azure OpenAI Service, Cognitive Services, and AI Studio. Build real-world applications including chatbots, document intelligence solutions, and Copilot extensions while following Microsoft's best practices. |
| **Step 3 – Enterprise AI & Governance** | Implement enterprise-grade AI solutions with proper governance frameworks. Learn to configure content filters, set up monitoring and compliance, and create documentation that meets enterprise standards for AI deployment. |
